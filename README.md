Android and iOS app to save the locations you don't want to lose!

Main Features:
  - Completely free

### Version
1.2

### Tech

PlaceHolder uses a number of libraries:

* [GoogleMaps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/intro) - Google official API for maps customization!
* [Github](https://github.com/andreamontanari/PlaceHolder) - track down changes in your project
* [markdown-it](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.

And of course PlaceHolder itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/amontanari/PlaceHolder)
 on GitHub.

### Installation

  - Download PlaceHolder from Google Play Store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andreamontanari.placeholder)
  - Download PlaceHolder from App Store (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iplaceholder/id1155818508?l=it&ls=1&mt=8)

### Future Development

Want to contribute? Great!
I would like to add these functionalities to PlaceHolder:
- Use [Realm.io](https://realm.io) database for the locations storage
- Store more than 5 GPS positions
- Save current Latitude and Longitude, like this: [LT:45.4455322,LN: 9.1640499](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Via+dei+Crollalanza,+6,+20143+Milano/@45.4455322,9.1640499,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4786c3f201bb6751:0x5a10f2924c645c41!8m2!3d45.4455285!4d9.1662439)
